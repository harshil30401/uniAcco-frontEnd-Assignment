# uniAcco-frontEnd-Assignment (Airbnb clone)
Hi there,
Here is the assignment which was given to me on 28th October.
As mentioned in the word file shared with me, I have made sure that the requirements are met.
I have also added a few snapshots of the app and published the app on Girhub pages.

P.S: I do not have any prior experiences about the React.js or MaterialUI frameworks, hence i have used the regular Cascading Style Sheets, However, i am looking forward to learn those technologies.
